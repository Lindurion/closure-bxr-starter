Status
------
NOT ready for use yet. Implementation in progres...


Usage
-----
(First time only) Install node.js package dependencies:

    $ npm install

Run lint checks for good code conventions & style (edit `lint.js` to customize checks):

    $ node lint.js

Build your JS and CSS (include `--debug` for human-readable output):

    $ node build.js [--debug]

Run server:

    $ node server.js [--debug] [--port=8080] [--watch]

Then view in a web browser at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

You can either rerun `build.js` manually after making edits, or you can pass the `--watch` command-line flag when you run the server, which will listen for changes to files under this directory and automatically rebuild the project on next request if any files have changed.

Customize input files and output directories for the project by editing `project-config.js`.


### System Requirements ###

Java and Python version 2 must be installed and part of the system path as `java` and `python` in order to run all Closure tools. These commands are also configurable; see [closure-pro-build documentation](http://github.com/Lindurion/closure-pro-build#system-requirements) for more details.
